# Instrument Tuning Detection using Deep Learning

**A machine learning pipeline that detects whether an instrument is in tune or out of tune using deep learning models and audio feature extraction.**

This project was originally part of the **CS8321 Final Project** coursework and has been refactored, enhanced, and packaged into a clear, reproducible repository suitable for portfolio and professional use.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Musical instrument tuning detection involves analyzing audio signals to determine if an instrument is playing in tune. This project builds and evaluates deep learning models that classify audio samples as **in-tune** or **out-of-tune** based on learned representations from audio features.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Audio Feature Extraction:** Compute relevant audio features from instrument recordings to serve as input to ML models.
- **Deep Learning Classification:** Train, evaluate, and save models using popular architectures tailored for audio inspection.
- **Model Evaluation:** Analyze performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, and spectrogram insights.
- **Reproducible Workflow:** Notebooks and scripts that document the end-to-end process from raw data to model evaluation.

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Convert raw audio files into structured datasets.
   - Extract meaningful features such as spectrograms and embeddings (e.g., VGGish) for model training.

2. **Model Training**
   - Train neural network models using extracted features.
   - Experiment with architectures such as CNNs and MLPs for tuning detection.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate trained models on holdout sets.
   - Use performance metrics and visualizations to validate model behavior.

4. **Deployment Thoughts**
   - While this version focuses on research and modeling, the pipeline is structured for easy deployment into cloud services (e.g., GCP, AWS).

⏱ How to Run

To train a model:

python src/train_model.py --data-dir ./data

To evaluate:

python src/evaluate.py --model models/out_of_tune_detector_model.h5

To generate feature representations:

python src/features.py --input ./data/*.wav

(Adjust paths as needed)

🧪 Example Results

Model	Accuracy	Notes
CNN Spectrogram	86%	Best overall on held-out test set
MLP on VGGish Embeddings	83%	Requires less compute, still robust

(Replace with your actual final results)

## ✨ Tips to *improve* this README before pushing

✅ Add **project screenshots**  
✅ Add a **diagram of the pipeline (audio → features → model)**  
✅ Add **final metrics and evaluation plots**  
✅ Add a **Usage section with commands**  
✅ Include a **Live demo link** if you deploy it

If you want, I can generate a **diagram** or a **visual architecture graphic** you can embed in this README too.
